//! When the tray may write settings that came from its config, and what a device reading
//! does when it may not.
//!
//! The tray used to push its config to the device at every start. That is right for a
//! config the user made and wrong for one the tray made up. On a first run the "config"
//! was hardcoded defaults, so installing the tray put the laptop in Performance (Battery on
//! battery), turned the logo and keyboard backlight off, set an 80% charge limit, and
//! replaced whatever Synapse or the CLI had set. A file that did not parse was handled the
//! same way: defaults, applied, then saved over it.
//!
//! Upstream's fix (blauzim/razer-ctl 435c870, `load_config_or_adopt`) reads the device once,
//! copies that one reading into BOTH profiles and then applies it. That writes an
//! observation back to the device, which [`DeviceState::read`] prohibits, and it makes the
//! battery profile a copy of whatever the laptop was doing on AC. This module does neither:
//!
//! - A profile that was never set ([`Unset`]) is adopted from a reading taken on its own
//!   power source, and the reading is never written back.
//! - The other source's profile stays unset until the laptop is first seen on it.
//! - While the power source is unknown and a profile is unset, nothing is adopted.
//! - A config that does not parse, or cannot be read, is never applied: the tray only
//!   observes until it parses again or the user resets it from the menu.
//!
//! Pure decisions: [`on_reading`] takes no transport, so adopting a reading cannot write
//! one. The tests drive it from [`DeviceState::read`] over a mock transport that panics on
//! anything but a getter.
